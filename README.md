# Users-CRUD
Single page user management application using the CompanyAPI backend.

The JS frontend interacts with the API using the REST ideology.
Implementing a complete front-end user interface for CRUD operations:
1. Creation of users - through a form in a separate area of the application. The area should appear on the "add user" button and hide if the addition was successful. The add form checks the correctness of filling in the data.
2. Displaying the list of users - through a table with buttons - "edit", "delete" on each line in the extreme right column.
3. Deleting a user - by clicking on the "delete" button in the table from point 2.
4. Editing the user through the form in a separate area of the application. The area should appear when you click on the "edit" button in the table opposite the corresponding user and hide if the editing was successful. The edit form checks the correctness of filling in the data.
In response to deletions, additions, and edits of users, the table is updated automatically.
